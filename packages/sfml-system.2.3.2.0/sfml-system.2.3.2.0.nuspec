    <description>SFML provides a simple interface to the various components
		of your PC, to ease the development of games and multimedia applications.
		It is composed of five modules: system, window, graphics, audio and network.

        With SFML, your application can compile and run out of the box on the most
		common operating systems: Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and soon Android &amp; iOS.

        SFML has official bindings for the C and .Net languages. And thanks to its
		active community, it is also available in many other languages such as Java, Ruby, Python, Go, and more.</description>
